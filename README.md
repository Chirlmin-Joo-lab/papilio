## Installation - advanced

Clone the git repository:

```batch
clone https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/ivoseverins/traceanalysis.git
```

Create a conda environment named `trace_analysis` based on the `environment.yml` file. (Make sure you are in the main folder)

```batch
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

## Using the software - advanced

Either start the GUI by (use `pythonw` instead of `python` on Mac)

```batch
python GUI.py
```

Or start python and import the `Experiment` and `InteractivePlot` classes from the `trace_analysis` library located in the `traceanalysis` folder:

```python
from trace_analysis import Experiment
from trace_analysis import InteractivePlot
```

An example script using these classes can be found in the `Example.py` file. 

## Updating - advanced

Pull the latest version from the git repository and update the `trace_analysis` environment if necessary:

``` batch
conda env update --file environment.yml --prune
```
