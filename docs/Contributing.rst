Contributing
============

To add a new feature, create a new branch. In this feature branch you commit your changes.

Once the feature is working, push the branch and create a merge request on GitLab.

Assign someone else to test the code. If the other person's test is succesful and if he/she thinks the addition is useful, the other person leaves an OK comment in the merge request.

Then the merge request will be accepted and the feature branch will be deleted.
